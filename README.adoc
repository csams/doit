= Shared TODO
:toc:

== Overview
Shared TODO allows multiple users to create task lists and share them with
others. Each user has one list and may grant other users view-only or edit
access to it.

A task list is private to its creator unless explicitly shared.

A task may be marked private so users other than the task owner may not view or
edit it even if the owner's task list is shared.

A user logs into the application using an OAuth2 flow.

A user interacts with lists from the command line.

== Data Model
The primary pieces of data are the Task and the User.

Secondary data enable task list sharing.

== Components
- CLI for user interaction
- REST server (resource server)
- SQL Database to store tasks
- OIDC authorization server

== Operational Features
- Metrics to enable SLOs, alerts, and dashboards
- Audit logging
